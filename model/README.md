### Breaking Changes

This package mostly follows semver. Patches will be released in the following format:

- `x.*.*` Breaking change that also requires a new version of `gw2lib`
  - updates automatically when updating `gw2lib`
- `*.x.*` Breaking change that is required because of api changes
  - updates automatically with `cargo update`
- `*.*.x` New endpoint/non-breaking change
  - updates automatically with `cargo update`

### Endpoints

An endpoint gets marked as completed once it's mapped out and a small test runs in CI.

Please do help out mapping the API! All you need to do is create the necessary struct and quickly implement 2 traits. If you need help, feel free to reach out.
You don't even need to fork this library to test your struct!
